      text: "The dazzling and innocuous colors of cyanobacteria blooms do not fully reveal just how toxic they can be. Sometimes, a full-scale problem may not be visually noticeable. Droughts and extreme agricultural run-off can lead to an explosive growth of toxic cyanobacteria, forming a blanket of scum that prevents light from reaching deeper into the water column and degrading aquatic habitats, and creating low or depleted oxygen in a water body. The global proliferation of CyanoHABs have presented a major risk to the public and wildlife, and ecosystem and economic services provided by inland water resources (Image source: Dr.Susan Wilde, UGA)",

      title: "Our Approach",
      text: "Accurate, cost-effective, and targeted monitoring of these events is pivotal as the frequency and magnitude of CyanoHABs have grown, particularly in the summer months. A group of researchers  from diverse disciplines at The University of Georgia, Athens, developed a framework called CyanoTRACKER that seamlessly integrates community observations (Social Cloud), remote sensing measurements (Sesnor Cloud), and advanced multimedia analytics (Computational Cloud) for effective CyanoHABs monitoring. All components of CyanoTRACKER provided important data related to CyanoHABs assessments in global inland water bodies. Reports and data received via the social cloud, including platforms such as  X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and CyanoTRACKER website, help identify the geographic locations of CyanoHABs affected water bodies for tracking, mapping, and disseminating CyanoHABs information to the community.
