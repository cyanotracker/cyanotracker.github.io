# Project name: CyanoTracker

# Description
The dazzling and innocuous colors of cyanobacteria blooms do not fully reveal just how toxic they can be. Sometimes, a full-scale problem may not be visually noticeable. Droughts and extreme agricultural run-off can lead to an explosive growth of toxic cyanobacteria, forming a blanket of scum that prevents light from reaching deeper into the water column and degrading aquatic habitats, and creating low or depleted oxygen in a water body. The global proliferation of CyanoHABs have presented a major risk to the public and wildlife, and ecosystem and economic services provided by inland water resources (Image source: Dr.Susan Wilde, UGA).

   npm run build
   
2. Deploy to gh-pages:
   
   npm run deploy
   

# Branches
- main: The main branch contains the React project source code.
- gh-pages: This is the production branch, hosting the built version of the project.

## Services Used
# SupaBase:
This project uses Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative that provides backend infrastructure on PostgreSQL.


 Database: A scalable and fully-managed PostgreSQL database for structured and unstructured data, supporting real-time subscriptions.
 Storage: Flexible file storage with support for large files and media, easily accessible through public or private URLs.
API: Auto-generated APIs with REST and real-time capabilities to interact with the database.

### For this project, Supabase handles:

Data Storage: User-submitted form data and image uploads are stored securely in Supabase’s database and file storage.
Data Retrieval: Data is retrieved seamlessly in real-time for display and analysis.
File Storage: Image files uploaded by users are stored in Supabase’s Storage Bucket, providing secure, public access as needed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
